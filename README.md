## Your app's core functionality
> Does your app function differently based on a user's geolocation or language? If yes, why? *

Type 1:
```
Geolocation-Based Functionality:
My app maintains a consistent experience for users across all geolocations. We do not implement any changes or features that vary based on a user's location. The app's functionality remains the same, irrespective of the user's geographical location.

Language-Based Functionality:
Similarly, our app offers a uniform experience for all users, regardless of language. It does not exhibit variations or changes in functionality based on the user's language settings. The app's interface, content, and features remain constant for users in all language preferences.

We have intentionally designed our app to provide a standardized and consistent experience for all users globally.
```

Type 2:
```
 Our app, [App Name], is designed to be accessible and enjoyable for users from all over the world. While the app is currently available in English language, we understand that a diverse range of users will be accessing it.
```
Type 3 :
```
Yes, our app 'Your App Name' functions differently based on a user's geolocation and language. Here's why:

Geolocation-based functionality: We implemented this feature to provide location-specific content tailored to users' geolocations. By leveraging Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), we can push notifications or updates relevant to users' locations, such as local events or cultural insights. This helps create a more engaging and personalized user experience, approximating language learning to real-life applications.

Language-based functionality: Our app supports over ten languages, and we've designed the user interface to cater to users' preferences. By detecting users' language preferences through their device settings, we can display the app's content and exercises in their preferred language, improving relevance and usability for a broader audience.

In both cases, we prioritize user privacy and security by adhering to Google's policies related to location services and sensitive data management.

```
In the 'Your App Name' app, we take compliance with Google's policies seriously, particularly in the use of third-party codes and SDKs. The two third-party libraries we incorporated in our app are 'barteksc AndroidPdfViewer' and 'Volley Android'. Here's how we ensure that these integrate well with Google's policies:

Comprehensive Review of Third-Party Policies: Before incorporating any third-party libraries into our application, we carry out an intensive review of their policies to ensure they align with Google's requirements. This review process includes data handling, privacy, security, and other significant aspects of policy compliance.

Adherence to Licensing Agreements: We make certain that our use of 'barteksc AndroidPdfViewer' and 'Volley Android' remains within the bounds of their respective licensing agreements, which don't contradict with Google's own policy baseline.

Regular Privacy and Security Audits: Our team conducts frequent security audits which include the examination of the third-party codes to ensure they align securely with the application and don't pose any threat to data security or user privacy, which are in concurrence with Google's standards.

Timely Updates: Keeping abreast of updates from third-party libraries is key. Updates often address security issues, patch vulnerabilities, and introduce improvements that increase compliance with standards and policies. Hence, we ensure timely updates of these third-party codes in our app.

Regular Testing: Rigorous tests are performed to ensure that functionality elicited from these third-party codes works seamlessly within our app while adhering to Google's policies.

Transparency and Documentation: Keeping precise records of policy compliance for any third-party code is crucial. We maintain comprehensive documentation for every library we use, which includes 'barteksc AndroidPdfViewer' and 'Volley Android.'

By implementing these measures, we are confident that our use of third-party codes and SDKs in the 'Your App Name' app is in full compliance with Google's policies.
